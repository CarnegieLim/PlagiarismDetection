# Plagiarism Detection using String Matching

### Guides
This system contains two parts: Backend and Frontend.

Backend is implemented using Spring Boot. It locates at `/src`
To run backend:
`mvn spring-boot:run`
It will run on localhost:8080

Frontend is implemented using React.js. It locates at `/src/main/resources/web`
To run frontend:
`cd src/main/resources/web`
`yarn install`
`yarn start`
It will run on localhost:3000

### About Result
I have provided a screenshot, which locates under the project directory. It's `result.png`.
